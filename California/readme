state_forecasting.m is the main code calls all other code. 

First, import the data, 
Second, pull the data for the state that we are interested in interest
Third, run the multistar code to find the best estimates of parameters 
Fourth, use the final points of simulation which is from the first day of outbreak to the first day of relaxing restrictions, 
as initial conditions for the second multistart fit and estimate the parameters again. 
repead this process again and again.
